### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes. The 3rd Lab especially prepared me on how to use API and Javascript.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I want to clean up my javascript code and brush up on CSS and Bootstrap to make the site pretty.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The API went well. I didn't have a problem with gridding my movies. My peers put in a go back up button which I would love to utilize next time.
